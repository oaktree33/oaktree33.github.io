			In junior year, I had to "write" many LabView programs for the Digital Electronic class and lab. Some of them include integrated circuit chip emulation, serial communication through fiber optic cable using DAQ, and motor speed control.<br>
			However, being someone who had previous background in programming (in python and java), I found graphical programming time-consuming and limited. Although it is great at quickly whipping up decent graphical UI, it did not seem to be geared for serious programming.<br>
			Due to these facts I decided to research "text based coding in LabView" and present it to the class.
		</p>
		<h4>One might use text-based codes in LabView because it....:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>saves space on the Block Diagram</li>
			<li>is faster to type than drag and drop certain features</li>
			<li>allows to take advantage of pre-existing text-based codes</li>
			<li>extends the functionality of LabView</li>
			<li>exercises both hands instead of just one...</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			For the LabView 2011, there were four different methods in which to use text-based coding:
			<ul>
				<li>Formula Node</li>
				<li>Mathscript</li>
				<li>Matlab node</li>
				<li>DLL (C/C++)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I decided to take a simple and comical program as an example. The program was simulating the projection of an object thrown upward at a user given velocity, where the object was an image of a cat.<br>
			<img src="img/lv/catjumpgui.jpg"/><br>
			I implemented the same program 4 times, using the aforementioned text-based coding methods within LabView.
		</p>
		<h6>Formula Node</h6>
		<p>
			There is a graphical element within LabView called the "formula node", placing this element onto the block diagram will take a form of a text-box that can be connected to input and output elements.<br>
			Below is the image of the cat jump program implemented with the formula node:<br>
			<img class = "lvImg" src="img/lv/formulanode.jpg"/><br>
			The text code allowed for the formula node is reminiscent of a very simplified version of C with built in arithmetic functions. The list of available functions are detailed in this <a href ="http://zone.ni.com/reference/en-XX/help/371361D-01/lvhowto/formula_node_and_express/">site</a>.

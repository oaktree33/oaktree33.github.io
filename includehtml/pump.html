		<h1> Peristaltic Pump Project </h1>
		<h3>Objective:</h3>
		<p>
			The goal of this project was to develop a low-budget peristaltic pump for the application of our choice.
			<br>
			We chose design and prototype a peristaltic pump for gastric feeding.
		</p>
		<h3>Design Contraints:</h3>
		<p>
			Below is the list of typical contraints for gastric feeding pump:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Flow Rate
				<ul>
					<li>
						Increment of 0.1ml/hr from 0.1 ml/hr to 10ml/hr
					</li>
					<li>
						Error needs to be within 5 percent.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Compatibility
				<ul>
					<li>
						The tubing used must be compatible with the standardized feeding solutions.
					</li>
					<li>
						Must be biocompatible with various vitamins, proteins, glucose, and lipids.
					</li>
					<li>
						Feeding solutions are usually at least 70% water.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>
				Requires daily replacement of tubing by the nurses or therapists.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Resource Contraints:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				Budget: $100
			</li>
			<li>
				Material Processng tools: Laser Cutter, and Fusion Deposit Modeller.
			</li>
			<li>
				Building Materials: Acrylic sheets, and Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene(ABS)
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Final Concept Design:</h3>
		<p>
			Below was the final concept design:
		</p>

		<p>
			Each layer is an acrylic sheet. The thickness of the pump case, and the rotary assembly has been dimensioned to accomodate the chosen tubing and the desired flow rates.
			<br>
			The Tygon S-50-HL of 1/8 inch tubing was chosen for its 25-30 hour life and its slow flow rate (0.8cc per inch).
			<br>
			The inner circuilar plate and the associated rotary part can be easily slide out to facilitate tube replacement.
			<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Below is a short video of prototype demonstration:

		<p>
			The motor and gearbox assembly that we used was purchased from Tamiya.
			<br>
			The motor had the RPM of 6500, and the gear ratio that we chose was 1300:1. Such gear ratio was needed in order to achieve minimum flow rate of 0.1 ml per hour.

			Following video is a quick demonstration of the speed control by using pulse width modulation from a microcontroller.

			<source src="video/pump2.ogv" type="video/ogg" >
			<sourcew src="video/pump1.mp4">
		</video>
		<p>
			As you can see in the video, the gearbox and the rotary assembly can simply slide out of the outer casing.

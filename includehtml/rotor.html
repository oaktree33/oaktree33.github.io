		<h1>Solidworks Flow Simulator-Rotor </h1>
		<p>
			Due to the disappointing attempt at simulating air lift on a wing, I have decided to test the flow simulator on something simpler.<br>
			I chose to see if the flowsim was capable of simulating effects on the medium(water) due to a mechanical movment of objets in the medium.<br>
			Unfortunately, the flowsim was limited to rotating objects, and I had to choose to test it on a rotor, similar to the ones used for boats.<br>
			Additoinally, I found that the flowsim doesn't actually rotate the object, but rather asks the user to select a region of medium that will rotate around the object. I am not sure the reason for this approach, but I guess it was to simplify the calculations needed for the analysis.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>The Rotor:</h3>
		<p>Below is the image of the rotor I drafted out for this test. I have no experience in rotor design nor do I know how it works. Therefore, all I could do was make something that resembles a rotor.</p>

		<p>
			As mentioned above, after the initial set up I must indicate a region in which the medium will rotate around the object. This is done by encasing the object in question with a cylinder.<br>
			I drew a cylinder around the rotor and made it transparent as shown below.<br>
		</p>

			After inserting the region into the flowsim tree, and setting the radians per second to 90 (about 860 rpm), I defined the goals to be the Y direction force and the torque around the Y-axis.<br>
			Below is the video of the resulting flow trajectories:<br>

			The Y force converged to be about 153 Newtons. This force would be used to push the boat for example.<br>
			The Y axis torque value converged to be about 7.25 N*m. This would be the amount of load that the motor spinning the rotor will have to over come.<br>
			If my goal was to design the best rotor, I would tweak the design of the rotor until I get the lowest Y force to Y axis torque ratio.<br>
		</p>

			As far as testing this feature goes, it is a success. The Solidworks flowsimulatior seems to be useful in rotor design. Of course I can't be sure of its accuracy unless I have some proven standards to compare the result to.

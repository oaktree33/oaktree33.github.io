		<h1>Solidworks Flow Simulator-Rotor </h1>
		<p>
			Due to the disappointing attempt at simulating air lift on a wing, I have decided to test the flow simulator on something simpler.<br>
			I chose to see if the flowsim was capable of simulating effects on the medium(water) due to a mechanical movment of objets in the medium.<br>
			Unfortunately, the flowsim was limited to rotating objects, and I had to choose to test it on a rotor, similar to the ones used for boats.<br>
			Additoinally, I found that the flowsim doesn't actually rotate the object, but rather asks the user to select a region of medium that will rotate around the object. I am not sure the reason for this approach, but I guess it was to simplify the calculations needed for the analysis.<br>

		<h3>The Rotor:</h3>
		<p>Below is the image of the rotor I drafted out for this test. I have no experience in rotor design nor do I know how it works. Therefore, all I could do was make something that resembles a rotor.</p>

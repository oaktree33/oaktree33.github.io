		<h1>Solidworks Flow Simulator-Rotor </h1>
		<p>
			Due to the disappointing attempt at simulating air lift on a wing, I have decided to test the flow simulator on something simpler.<br>
			I chose to see if the flowsim was capable of simulating effects on the medium(water) due to a mechanical movment of objets in the medium.<br>
			Unfortunately, the flowsim was limited to rotating objects, and I had to choose to test it on a rotor, similar to the ones used for boats.<br>
			Additoinally, I found that the flowsim doesn't actually rotate the object, but rather asks the user to select a region of medium that will rotate around the object. I am not sure the reason for this approach, but I guess it was to simplify the calculations needed for the analysis.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>The Rotor:</h3>
		<p>Below is the image of the rotor I drafted out for this test. I have no experience in rotor design nor do I know how it works. Therefore, all I could do was make something that resembles a rotor.</p>

		<p>
			As mentioned above, after the initial set up I must indicate a region in which the medium will rotate around the object. This is done by encasing the object in question with a cylinder.<br>
			I drew a cylinder around the rotor and made it transparent as shown below.<br>
		</p>

		<p>
			After inserting the region into the flowsim tree, and setting the radians per second to 90 (about 860 rpm), I defined the goals to be the Y direction force and the torque around the Y-axis.<br>
			Below is the video of the resulting flow trajectories:<br>

			The Y force converged to be about 153 Newtons. This force would be used to push the boat for example.<br>
			The Y axis torque value converged to be about 7.25 N*m. This would be the amount of load that the motor spinning the rotor will have to overcome.<br>
			If my goal was to design the best rotor, I would tweak the design of the rotor until I get the lowest Y force to Y axis torque ratio.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			One thing to note is that the above calculation was done without the "cavitation" option enabled.<br>
			For those who are unfamiliar with the concept of cavitation here is a fun video explaining the basic concept of cavitation: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cp5gdUHFGIQ">Cavitation due to AK4</a><br>
			The calculation with the cavitation option enabled took about 35 minutes as opposed to 2 minutes without the cavitation option.<br>
			The results also differed. The Y direction force converged to about 105 Newtons, and the Y-axis torque converged to about 6 Newton meters. Both of these values are significantly lower than the ones given by the calculation without the cavitation, and it leads me to believe that these values may be closer to the reality.<br>
			As for the visual trajectories of the calculations, they both were near identical.
		</p>
		<p>
			As far as testing this feature goes, it is a success. The Solidworks flowsimulatior seems to be useful in rotor design. Of course I can't be sure of its accuracy unless I have some proven standards to compare the result to.

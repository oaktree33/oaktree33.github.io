		<h1>Model Airplane wing Analysis</h1>
		<p>I was curious in the capability of the Solidwork Flow Simulator, and decided to explore it with an airplane wing as a test subject.</p>

		<p>This is the wing model, I used to test the flow simulator. The main goal that I was looking for was the amount of lifting force that this wing could provide.</p>
		<img class="wingImg" src="img/sw/analysis result.jpg"/>
		<p>This was the result of the calculation done by the flow swim. As it indicates, the lift provided by this wing is approximately 4.6 gram force(p). However, the mass of the wing is approximately 22.78 grams, if the wing is made out of a type of polystyrene. This may be due to bad design of the wing, or due to simulation error or user settings error.</p>
		<p>Below is the video simulation of the airflow around the wing. The flow rate was set to 20 miles per hour, and the color of the particles indicate the calculted pressure value of the medium, which was set to default air.

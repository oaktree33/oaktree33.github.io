		<h1>Graphite Mold for Casting Brass Pipe Fitting Casting</h1>
		<h3>Objective:</h3>
		<p>
			The goal of this small project was to design and machine a graphite mold for casting brass into a pipe fitting. The specific fitting type is a male to barbed fitting.<br>
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/maletobarbedfitting.jpg">
		</p>
		<h3>Limitations:</h3>
		<p>There were few limitations due to the available resources and tools.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Graphite cylinder Size: The mold had to be cut from a graphite cylinder of diameter 4.5 inches and height of 6 inches.</li>
			<li>The mold had to be machinable only using lathe and hand tools.</li>
			<li>The mold had to be reusable.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>The Fitting</h3>
		<p>
			The first step I took was to create a solidwork model of the pipe fitting that I intended to make a mold for.<br>
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/SW_pipe_fitting.JPG"><br>
			The template model for the pipe fitting did not have to be this detailed, but I placed the details for practice.<br>
		</p>
		<p>
			These steps were used to simplify the template model and to build the mold:<br>
			<ol>
				<li>The threads and the barbs were filled more material to create a smooth surface.</li>
				<li>The scale tool in the SolidWorks Mold Tools set was used to compensate the volume shrinkage of the typical brass metal during solidification and cooling.</li>
				<li>The Draft Analysis and draft tools were used to give a 3 degree draft to the model in the directions where the fitting would be pulled away from mold.</li>
				<li>The Parting Line tool was used to indicate at which plane, the mold will be separated in two parts</li>
				<li>The Shut-Off Surfaces tool was used to specify which "surrounded volume" would be part of which mold-part</li>
				<li>The parting Surfaces tool was used to clearly indicate the separation point between the two mold parts</li>
				<li>Finally, the Tooliing Split tool was used to create the two parts of the mold.</li>
			</ol>
			
			I repeated the above steps two model 4 different designs for the mold

		<ul>

		</ul>
		
		<p>In the end, the design 4 was chosen due to its simple design and fabrication method.</p>
		
		<h3>Fabricating the Mold</h3>
		<p>
			The main tool used to fabricate the mold was the lathe. We made our custom cutting tool out of high speed steel. This cutting tool had length equal to the pipe fitting that we desired to cast, and had double cutting edges (each tapered at approximately 3 degrees).<br>
			This allowed us to fabricate both inner and outer tapering surfaces in a single lathe process.<br>
			We were successful in fabricating the mold giving slighly more leeway in the outer and inner diameter of the pipe fitting.<br>
		</p>
		<h3>Casting the brass</h3>
		<p>
			We used an electric meltring furnace to heat the scrap brass and copper pennies into molten brass. The Copper zinc alloy melted at about 1150 degrees celsius. The molten brass then poured into the graphite mold that was at room temperature.<br>
		</p>
		<h4>Initial Problems:</h4>
		<p>
			Unfortunately, there were few unforseen problems:
			<ul>
				<li>The 3 degree taper in the inner cone of the mold was insufficient for the cast to be removed from the mold. <br>
					As the molten brass shrunk during solidification and cooling, the cast created a tight grip on to the cone shaped extrusion of the mold. This grip was so tight that the cast could not be removed without breaking the cone-extrusion itself.
				</li>
				<li>The surface of the cast was uneven, and a lot of bumps and dips were present. <br>
					The mold's inner surface was not smooth as desired due to the undesired flexing of our cutting tool.
				</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<h4>Solutions to Initial Problems</h4>
		<p>
			The first problem was addressed by removing the cone-shaped extrusion and replacing with a destructable "cone core" made out of resusable "green sand" or casting sand.<br>
			We cut a circular slot at the bottom of the mold where the cone-shaped casting sand structure can be fitted for the casting.<br>
			The images below shows the graphite mold and the cone-shaped extrusion core made from casting sand:<br>
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/mold_top.jpg">
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/mold_top_core.jpg">
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/mold_top_corein.jpg">
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/mold_side_incore.jpg">
			<br>
			The second problem was addressed by using a standard metal cutting tool, and the taper attachment on our lathe to refinish the inner surfaces of the mold.<br>
			<br>
			Below images show the resulting cast:<br>
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/cast_side.jpg">
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/cast_top.jpg">
			<img class="moldImg" src="img/mold/cast_bottom.jpg">
			<br>
			The casting sand core can be easily broken and removed. 
		</p>
		<h3>Post machining:</h3>
		<p>
			The resulting brass cast was then machined with the lathe to smooth out the surfaces and to create the threading and the barbs.<br>
